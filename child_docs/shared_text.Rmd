implications_text <- "Declining commercial (total and seafood) landings and recreational harvest can be driven by many interacting factors, including combinations of ecosystem and stock production, management actions, market conditions, and environmental change. While we cannot evaluate all possible drivers at present, here we evaluate the extent to which stock status, management, and system biomass trends may play a role."

risks_setting_catch_drivers <- "Fish productivity and condition are affected by increasing metabolic demands from increasing temperature, combined with changes in the availability and quality of prey. Long-term environmental trends and episodic extreme temperatures, ocean acidification, and low oxygen events represent multiple stressors that can affect growth rates, reproductive success, recruitment, and cause mortality."

forage_quality <- "The amount of forage fish available in the ecosystem combined with the energy content of the forage species determines the amount of energy potentially available to predators in the ecosystem. Changes in the forage base can drive managed and protected species production.

The [energy content](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/energy_density.html) of juvenile and adult forage fish as prey is related to forage fish growth and reproductive cycles, as well as environmental conditions. The energy content of Atlantic herring was estimated to be highest of any forage species in the 1980s and 1990s, based on very small numbers of fish. Most observations from the NEFSC trawl surveys are below the previous estimates (Fig. \ref{fig:energy-density}). However, a recent study that included samples from additional sources indicated herring energy density peaked in summer, with some values closer to the historic estimates.Silver hake, longfin squid (*Loligo* in figure) and shortfin squid (*Illex* in figure) remain lower than previous estimates."

oa_paragraph <- "[Ocean acidification](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/ocean_acidification.html) risks vary among species and include reduced survival, growth, reproduction, and productivity, where high OA risk indicates potential negative effects to species. OA risk can also be heightened during colder conditions due to increased $CO_2$ absorption by the water or by transport of high $CO_2$ water masses (see [highlights section](#highlights)). Higher OA risk conditions were observed for Atlantic sea scallop and longfin squid in Long Island Sound and the nearshore and mid shelf regions of the New Jersey shelf during summers of 2016, 2018, 2019, 2023, and 2024 (Fig. \ref{fig:mab-oa}). The OA indicator observed on the Mid-Atlantic coastal shelf during summer 2024 was the most extreme recorded when compared to all of the years sampled (since 2007)."

wind_indicator_paragraph <- "Offshore wind indicators are based on federal logbook data and do not include all data for all fisheries; therefore a complete evaluation of potential offshore wind energy development impacts would need to be supplemented by other data sources. For further information on the utility of the data, see the [socioeconomic impacts of offshore wind development data reports page](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/data/socioeconomic-impacts-atlantic-offshore-wind-development)."

wind_interactions <- "Proposed wind development areas interact with the region’s federal scientific surveys. Scientific surveys are impacted by offshore wind in four ways:
1. Exclusion of NOAA Fisheries’ sampling platforms from the wind development area due to operational and safety limitations.
2. Impacts on the random-stratified statistical design that is the basis for scientific assessments, advice, and analyses.
3. Alteration of benthic and pelagic habitats, and airspace in and around the wind energy development, requiring new designs and methods to sample new habitats.
4. Reduced sampling productivity through navigation impacts of wind energy infrastructure on aerial and vessel survey operations.

Increased vessel transit between stations may decrease data collections that are already limited by annual days-at-sea day allocations. The total survey area overlap ranges from 1-70% for all Greater Atlantic federal surveys as of 2024. Individual survey strata have significant interaction with wind areas, including the sea scallop survey (up to 96% of individual strata) and the bottom trawl survey (up to 60% strata overlap). Additionally, up to 50% of the southern New England North Atlantic right whale survey’s area overlaps with proposed project areas and a region-wide survey mitigation program is underway."

socio_intro <- "The socio-demographic conditions, and resultant vulnerabilities, of some communities may further exacerbate the impacts of offshore wind development in the Northeast such that the impacts of offshore wind development are expected to differentially [impact specific coastal communities](https://noaa-edab.github.io/catalog/wind_port.html) (Fig. \ref{fig:wea-port-rev}). Additionally, impacts of offshore wind development may unevenly affect individual operators, with some permit holders deriving a much higher proportion of revenue from wind areas than the port-based mean."
