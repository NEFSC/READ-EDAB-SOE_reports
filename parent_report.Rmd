The information in this report is organized into two main sections; [performance measured against ecosystem-level management objectives](#performance-relative-to-fishery-management-objectives) (Table \ref{tab:management-objectives}), and potential [risks to meeting fishery management objectives](#risks-to-meeting-fishery-management-objectives) (Table \ref{tab:management-risks}: [climate change](#climate-and-ecosystem-change) and [other ocean uses](#other-ocean-uses-offshore-wind)). A final section highlights [notable 2024 ecosystem observations](#highlights).
